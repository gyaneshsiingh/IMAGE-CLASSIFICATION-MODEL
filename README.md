# ðŸ§  CNN Image Classification (CIFAR-10 with TensorFlow)

This notebook builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** (10 classes, e.g. airplane, car, cat).

## ðŸ§° Tools Used:
- `tensorflow.keras` for model architecture
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for plotting
- `sklearn.metrics` for evaluation

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Included:
- Data loading & normalization
- CNN model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout
- Training with validation
- Accuracy/loss plots
- Confusion matrix and classification report
